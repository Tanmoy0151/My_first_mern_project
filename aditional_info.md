## Project Overview
### Objective
To build a comprehensive E-commerce website using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack that supports multiple sellers, multiple admins, a live dashboard for both sellers and admins, multiple users purchasing products, live chat customer support, and order tracking for both sellers and users.

### Scope
- Multiple seller registration and management
- Multiple admin functionalities
- User registration and purchasing
- Live dashboards for sellers and admins
- Live chat customer support for each order
- Order tracking for both sellers and users
## Technical Stack
### Frontend
- React.js: For building interactive user interfaces.
- Redux: For state management.
- Material-UI: For design components and theming.
### Backend
- Node.js: For building the server-side application.
- Express.js: For handling server routes and APIs.
- Database
- MongoDB: For storing user, product, order, and chat data.
- Others
-- Socket.io: For real-time communication (live chat).
-- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure authentication.
-- AWS S3: For storing product images and other static assets.
-- Stripe/PayPal API: For payment processing.
## System Architecture

### User Authentication:

  - Users, sellers, and admins log in/sign up.
  - JWT tokens issued for authenticated sessions.
### Product Management:

- Sellers add/update/delete products.
- Products stored in MongoDB and images in AWS S3.
### Order Processing:

- Users place orders.
- Orders are tracked and updated in MongoDB.
- Payment processing via Stripe/PayPal.
- Live Chat:

- Day 10: Deployment and Documentation
Deploy backend to a cloud service (e.g., AWS EC2).
Deploy frontend to a static hosting service (e.g., Netlify).
Finalize project documentation.

## Development Workflow
Version Control: Use Git for version control. Branching strategy:

main: Production-ready code.
dev: Development branch.
Feature branches for new features.
Code Review: Use pull requests for code reviews before merging to dev.

Continuous Integration: Setup CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

## Deployment Plan
Backend: Deploy on AWS EC2 with a Node.js environment.
Frontend: Deploy on Netlify or Vercel.
Database: MongoDB Atlas for managed database services.
Cloud Storage: AWS S3 for storing images and static assets.
Risk Management
Scope Creep: Strictly adhere to the initial project scope.
Technical Challenges: Regular team meetings to discuss and resolve blockers.
Time Management: Daily stand-ups to ensure timelines are met.
Security: Implement security best practices (e.g., HTTPS, data encryption).
